# üéØ AI Agent Development Plan

A comprehensive development plan based on analyzing the entire project and the principles of 12-factor agents.

## üìä Current Implementation Status

**‚úÖ Completed (Factor 1-5)**
- **Factor 1**: Natural language to tool call conversion system
- **Factor 2**: Prompt management system (dynamic prompt functionality)  
- **Factor 3**: Context window management (token optimization, message prioritization)
- **Factor 4**: Tools are just structured outputs (enhanced tool execution, validation, tracing)
- **Factor 5**: Unified execution state with business state (event-driven thread management)

**üìÅ Key Components**
- `TaskCreatorAgent`: Main agent with Factor 3-5 integration (refactored to 270 lines)
- `ConversationManager`: Conversation state and flow control management
- `CollectedInfoManager`: User information collection and organization
- `DisplayManager`: Centralized display and logging functionality
- `PromptManager`: Dynamic prompt selection and management
- `ContextManager`: Strategic context window optimization (Factor 3)
- `EnhancedToolExecutor`: Structured tool outputs with validation (Factor 4)
- `AgentThreadManager`: Unified state management with event sourcing (Factor 5)
- `ThreadRecoveryManager`: Thread recovery and serialization features
- `ClaudeClient`: Anthropic Claude API integration
- `NotionClient`: Notion API integration and GTD system

### ‚ö° **Phase 3: Factor 8-10 Implementation (Control & Error Handling)**

**Factor 8: Control Flow Within Agent**
```typescript
// Control flow management
- Complex processing flow design
- Conditional branching and loop processing
- Flow visualization and debugging features
```

**Factor 9: Compact Errors into Context**
```typescript
// Error management
- Error information integration into context
- Learning from errors functionality
- Automatic recovery features
```

**Factor 10: Small, Focused Agents**
```typescript
// Micro-agent design
- Single responsibility agent design
- Inter-agent collaboration features
- Dynamic agent composition
```

### üèóÔ∏è **Phase 4: Factor 11-12 Implementation (Architecture Completion)**

**Factor 11: Triggerable from Anywhere**
```typescript
// Trigger system
- Webhook support
- Scheduled execution
- Event-driven execution
```

**Factor 12: Stateless Reducers**
```typescript
// Stateless design
- Pure function-based agent implementation
- Predictable behavior guarantee
- Enhanced testability
```

## üí° Implementation Tips

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Implement each Factor independently without affecting existing functionality
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Always develop new features with accompanying tests
3. **Documentation**: Update design documents when implementing each Factor
4. **Practicality Focus**: Design as actually usable features, not just for learning purposes

This plan enables systematic learning of 12-factor agents principles while building a practical AI agent system.
