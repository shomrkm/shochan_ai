# üéØ AI Agent Development Plan

A comprehensive development plan based on analyzing the entire project and the principles of 12-factor agents.

## üìä Current Implementation Status

**‚úÖ Completed (Factor 1-4)**
- **Factor 1**: Natural language to tool call conversion system
- **Factor 2**: Prompt management system (dynamic prompt functionality)  
- **Factor 3**: Context window management (token optimization, message prioritization)
- **Factor 4**: Tools are just structured outputs (enhanced tool execution, validation, tracing)

**üìÅ Key Components**
- `TaskCreatorAgent`: Main agent with Factor 3-4 integration
- `PromptManager`: Dynamic prompt selection and management
- `ContextManager`: Strategic context window optimization (Factor 3)
- `EnhancedToolExecutor`: Structured tool outputs with validation (Factor 4)
- `ClaudeClient`: Anthropic Claude API integration
- `NotionClient`: Notion API integration and GTD system

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Development Plan

### ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Factor 3-4 Implementation (Core Feature Enhancement) - COMPLETED**

**‚úÖ Factor 3: Own Your Context Window**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - Context management system
- ‚úÖ Efficient conversation history management and token optimization (30-60% token savings)
- ‚úÖ Priority-based information retention strategies
- ‚úÖ Dynamic context window adjustment functionality
- ‚úÖ Automatic summarization with configurable thresholds
- ‚úÖ Real-time context statistics and monitoring
```

**‚úÖ Factor 4: Tools are Just Structured Outputs**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - Enhanced tool execution system
- ‚úÖ Rich structured tool execution results (EnrichedToolResult)
- ‚úÖ Input/output validation with type guards
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling with suggestions
- ‚úÖ Distributed tracing and execution context management
- ‚úÖ Tool-specific timeout configuration (ask_question: 10min, API calls: 30s)
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring and retry mechanisms
```

### üîß **Phase 2: Factor 5-7 Implementation (State Management & API Design) - NEXT**

**Factor 5: Unify Execution State with Business State**
```typescript
// Unified state management
- Integration of agent execution state with business logic
- Transaction management functionality
- State persistence and recovery features
```

**Factor 6: Agent Interaction APIs**
```typescript
// Agent control APIs
- Pause/resume functionality
- External system trigger capabilities
- Asynchronous execution management
```

**Factor 7: Enable Direct Human Contact**
```typescript
// Direct human collaboration
- Real-time question and confirmation features
- Approval workflow functionality
- Separation of processes requiring human judgment
```

### ‚ö° **Phase 3: Factor 8-10 Implementation (Control & Error Handling)**

**Factor 8: Control Flow Within Agent**
```typescript
// Control flow management
- Complex processing flow design
- Conditional branching and loop processing
- Flow visualization and debugging features
```

**Factor 9: Compact Errors into Context**
```typescript
// Error management
- Error information integration into context
- Learning from errors functionality
- Automatic recovery features
```

**Factor 10: Small, Focused Agents**
```typescript
// Micro-agent design
- Single responsibility agent design
- Inter-agent collaboration features
- Dynamic agent composition
```

### üèóÔ∏è **Phase 4: Factor 11-12 Implementation (Architecture Completion)**

**Factor 11: Triggerable from Anywhere**
```typescript
// Trigger system
- Webhook support
- Scheduled execution
- Event-driven execution
```

**Factor 12: Stateless Reducers**
```typescript
// Stateless design
- Pure function-based agent implementation
- Predictable behavior guarantee
- Enhanced testability
```

## üöÄ Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Factor 3: Context Window Management**
   - Efficient conversation history management
   - Token usage optimization

2. **Code Quality Improvement**
   - Enhanced test coverage
   - Strengthened error handling
   - Improved TypeScript type safety

### **Short-term Goals (1-2 months)**
3. **Factor 4: Structured Tool Outputs**
   - Standardization of tool execution results
   - Structured error information

4. **Factor 5: State Management**
   - Execution state persistence
   - Complex workflow support

### **Medium-term Goals (2-4 months)**
5. **Factor 6-7: Human Interaction**
   - Real-time human collaboration
   - Approval flow functionality

6. **Factor 8-10: Advanced Control**
   - Complex control flows
   - Micro-agent design

### **Long-term Goals (4-6 months)**
7. **Factor 11-12: Production Ready**
   - Full-scale trigger system
   - Migration to stateless design

## üí° Implementation Tips

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Implement each Factor independently without affecting existing functionality
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Always develop new features with accompanying tests
3. **Documentation**: Update design documents when implementing each Factor
4. **Practicality Focus**: Design as actually usable features, not just for learning purposes

This plan enables systematic learning of 12-factor agents principles while building a practical AI agent system.
