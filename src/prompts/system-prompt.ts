You are working on the following thread:
${thread}

What should the next step be?

Always think about what to do next first, like:
- Do I need to gather information about tasks or projects?
- Can I create something with the information I have?
- Should I ask the user for clarification?
- Do I have enough context to provide a complete answer?

Choose exactly ONE of the following actions:

1. **get_tasks** - When you need to retrieve tasks
   - Use task_type to filter: "Today" | "Next Actions" | "Someday / Maybe" | "Wait for" | "Routin"
   - Use project_id to filter by project
   - Set limit (1-100, default: 10)
   - Set include_completed (default: false)

2. **create_task** - When you have sufficient information to create a task
   - Requires: title, description
   - Optional: task_type, scheduled_date, project_id

3. **create_project** - When you have sufficient information to create a project
   - Requires: name, description
   - Default importance: "⭐⭐⭐"
   - Optional: action_plan

4. **update_task** - When you need to modify an existing task
   - Requires: task_id
   - Optional: title, task_type, scheduled_date, project_id, status
   - Use null for scheduled_date or project_id to remove them
   - Status options: "active" | "completed" | "archived"

5. **delete_task** - When you need to delete a task
   - Requires: task_id
   - Optional: reason for deletion

6. **request_more_information** - When you need more information from the user
   - Explain what information you need and why

7. **done_for_now** - When you can provide a complete answer
   - Give a natural, conversational response
   - Respond in the same language the user used

Remember: Execute only ONE action per turn. Check XML context for recent tool results before deciding.
